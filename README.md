# 🤖 Robot Delivery Simulation

A smart and interactive **Robot Delivery Simulation** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project simulates how a delivery robot navigates through different locations using optimized paths and smart decision-making.

## 📌 Features

- 🚀 **Start Simulation** – Begin robot delivery process
- 🤖 **Smart Mode** – Automatically selects optimized delivery paths
- 🔁 **Compare Robots** – Compare different robot strategies
- 🗺️ **Visual Map Grid** – Interactive map with connected locations
- ⚡ **Speed Control** – Switch between Fast & Slow simulation
- 📝 **Live Logs** – Turn-by-turn delivery status
- 📦 **Pickup & Delivery Tracking**

## 🧠 How It Works

- Locations (House, Shop, Farm, Post Office, etc.) are represented as **nodes**
- Roads between locations act as **edges**
- Robot chooses paths based on:
  - Shortest distance
  - Pending deliveries
  - Smart routing logic
- Simulation runs step-by-step with real-time logs
